## Is It Legal to Download Instagram Videos?

Let’s be clear: downloading someone else's content without permission can tread into copyright infringement territory. Instagram’s terms of service explicitly prohibit saving or redistributing content without proper consent.

### Expert Insight:

According to Sarah Klein, a digital rights attorney, "It’s always best to ask for permission or use content labeled for reuse. If you’re downloading videos for personal use, the legal risk is lower, but commercial use without rights can lead to serious consequences."
